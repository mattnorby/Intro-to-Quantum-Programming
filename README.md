# Intro-to-Quantum-Programming
Slides for my introductory talk about quantum programming.

This talk has been presented:
<ul><li>Twice at the Central Ohio Java User Group (COJUG), in December 2019.</li>
<li>At CodeMash, in January 2020.</li></ul>

Update: The CodeMash slides have been renamed to remove the words "final draft" and include "Jan 2020".  Also, there are two corrections on slide 16...  I had the "bra" and "ket" vectors switched, and the |01> vector shown incorrectly, in the final draft version.  They are correct in the Jan 2020 version.
